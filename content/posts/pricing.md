Pricing is one of the most critical decisions in lending, typically co-owned by the product and risk teams, as it has a direct and significant impact on customer behavior and product usage. Weâ€™ve often observed shifts in loan term adoption driven purely by changes in the pricing strategy. Because pricing and risk are inseparable, an effective pricing framework must be built on a comprehensive understanding of risk levels and their inherent uncertainty.

Several approaches can guide pricing decisions. One method focuses on the loss coverage ratio, ensuring that higher-risk segments are assigned higher margins to compensate for greater uncertainty. Another strategy relies on maintaining a minimum Return on Economic Capital (ROEC), embedding risk uncertainty into the return requirement. Both approaches ensure that pricing adequately covers expected losses and variability in performance. For low-risk segments, lenders may also consider competitive pricing to capture high-quality, low-margin balances and strengthen portfolio stability.

Initial pricing is usually set by discrete risk bands, but as customers progress through their lifecycle, a dynamic, risk-based pricing strategy becomes essential. This involves periodically reassessing rates to reflect updated risk profiles, particularly for customers whose risk ratings have deteriorated over time. The frequency and triggers for repricing depend on both business needs and the technical infrastructure supporting risk monitoring and pricing execution.
