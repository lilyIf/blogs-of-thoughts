Pricing is a very critical decision usually co-owned by product and risk, it can significanlty impact customers' usage of lending product. We have observed the shift of customers' adoption of different loan terms purely caused by the change of pricing strategy. Pricing and risk are inseperable, a good pricing strategy requires a fully understanding of risk and its uncertainty. When we talk of pricing, there are several strategies, such as the one focuses on loss coverage ratio which makes sure the higher ratio for higher risk to compensate for higher level of uncertainty, there is one based on mininal ROEC on capital. Both of them embed risk uncertainty into the ratio to ensure pricing can well cover risk and its uncertainty level. In addition, for low risk segment, lender can also consider to match competitor strategy to gain low risk low margin balance.

Initial pricing ties to discrete risk band; customer stage often requires risk-based dynamic pricing strategy, which means price will regularly be re-visited to reflect the risk level especially for risk downgrade population. In term of frequency or triggers, it usually requires the support of infrastructure and needs.
