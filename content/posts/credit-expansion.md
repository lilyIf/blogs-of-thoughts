Credit expansion should be one of most excited and daunting tasks for credit risk manager, as it's an uncharted landscape to step feet into. It has a wide coverage, from new market expansion, to new product expansion, to new population. Based on my experience on new product and new population expansion, it requires very cautious move. For new population expansion, which usually involves of high risk low credit history population, lender can either start with small population with sufficient reserve in finance or sell the risk externally to get learning benefit. For new product expansion, idealy it can leverage bureau to see internal population's external performance on product with similar features as new product to facilitate risk model development, or just get the sense of risk level by comparing their performance at the same risk level to form strategy. If new product has existed historically , it can be learned from historical data by mapping to one product which exist before and now, to gain the risk level in nowaday. If new product is a modification of an existing product, some level of proxy can be derived based on existing product, however given different loan terms target different borrowing needs and motivation, it's hard to generalize a relationship.

Once target default rate is defined for respective risk band, we need to ensure there is an early default indicator to be tracked regularly to monitor if performance expected. Any deviation needs to be investigated at granular level, such as vintage level, risk & revenue level to dissect root cause. If root cause can be removed to bring risk band back to target default rate, then we just need to deal with the back book and close the front book based on this root cause. However if root cause can't be identified, and it seems a miscalcualtion of target default rate or due to change of economic condition, then based on level of credit deviation we need to come up with next step strategy on both front and back book, to either increase the pricing or reduce of risk exposure on higher than expected risk segment to contain the risk. 


Credit expansion is one of the most exciting yet daunting responsibilities for a credit risk manager — it represents an uncharted landscape filled with opportunities and uncertainty. The scope is broad, covering new market entry, new product launches, and expansion into new customer populations.

From my experience in new product and population expansion, such initiatives require a highly cautious and data-driven approach. In new population expansion, which often targets higher-risk borrowers with limited credit history, lenders can either start small with sufficient financial reserves, or transfer part of the risk externally to gain early learning benefits.

In new product expansion, ideally, one can leverage credit bureau data to observe how existing customers perform externally on similar products, aiding model development and risk calibration. Alternatively, comparing products at similar risk levels can help estimate the expected risk level.

If the new product has historical precedence, it can be mapped to an existing product to infer today’s risk characteristics. When the new product is merely a variant of an existing offering, certain proxy relationships may be derived — however, because different loan terms attract different borrowing motivations, it is often challenging to generalize a direct relationship between the two.

Once target default rates are defined for each risk band, it becomes critical to establish early default indicators and track them regularly to ensure performance aligns with expectations. Any deviation should be investigated at a granular level — such as by vintage, risk tier, or revenue cohort — to dissect the root cause.

If the issue is identifiable and correctable, adjustments can be made to restore the portfolio to its target default level, while managing the back book and temporarily pausing new originations in affected segments. However, if the root cause is unclear, or stems from a miscalculated target rate or shifts in the economic environment, the lender must reassess strategy. Depending on the severity of deviation, this may include raising pricing, tightening credit criteria, or reducing exposure to risk segments to contain the risk.
