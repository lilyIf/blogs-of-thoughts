Initial Line Decision

Beyond the approval or decline decision at the application stage, the initial line assignment is another key step lenders must determine. The credit line represents the risk exposure — essentially, how much the lender is comfortable extending based on the borrower’s estimated repayment capacity.

Line evaluation depends on two main dimensions: repayment ability and risk level. The first ensures that the offered line is meaningful and appropriate given the borrower’s financial condition, such as income and borrowing needs. Ignoring this dimension can result in lines that are too low or irrelevant, making the product less attractive and reducing customer engagement and portfolio growth.

The second factor — risk control — ensures that exposure remains consistent with the lender’s overall risk appetite. Typically, a segmentation-based approach is applied, setting maximum line thresholds by risk tier to maintain portfolio-level consistency.

As mentioned earlier, repayment ability is the key input for line evaluation. It can be approximated as the cash available during the loan term, calculated by deducting debt obligations from income. Because longer loan terms introduce greater uncertainty, a 12-month loan should not simply double the line of a 6-month loan; instead, the 12-month line should be discounted to account for higher repayment uncertainty.

For small business loans, two major types exist:

Short-term loans for working capital needs, and

Long-term loans for business expansion.

For working capital loans — designed to bridge cash flow gaps when payables precede receivables — the COGS and OPEX components of revenue are included in line estimation. In contrast, for longer-term loans, the evaluation should consider EBITDA, ensuring sufficient profit margin to support repayment over time.

Customer Line Decision

Customer line management aims to reward and grow loyal customers while controlling risk exposure once early stress signals appear.

Line increases generally fall into two types:

Proactive line increases, where the lender offers higher limits to low-risk, high-need customers to maintain top-of-wallet positioning;

Reactive line increases, where customers request higher limits due to dissatisfaction with current line size.

For proactive increases, the challenge lies in identifying customer needs in real time while preserving risk control. This is often achieved through incremental debt sensitivity analysis, which stress-tests the upper boundary of the credit line.
For reactive increases, the challenge is to revisit the line logic effectively. Common solutions include requesting additional bank connections, updated financial statements, or enhanced income verification to support a revised line decision.

Line decreases can take several forms — line reduction, suspension, or account closure — depending on the severity of financial stress and repayment behavior. Early signals often arise from risk indicators or revenue deterioration. For instance, during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty such as the pandemic, lenders often reduced credit limits across portfolios, scaling down more aggressively in higher-risk bands to contain exposure.
Line suspension or account closure, effectively reducing exposure to zero, usually occurs under severe stress conditions, such as confirmed payment delinquencies or external defaults.

The most effective way to manage line decisions throughout the customer lifecycle is to maintain a consistent strategy and logic, while using adjustable ratios to reflect evolving risk levels and uncertainty over time.
