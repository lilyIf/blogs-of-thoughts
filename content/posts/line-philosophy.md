  Initial Line Decision

In addition to yes or no decision during the application stage, initial ine is one more key decision the lender needs to make. Line is risk exposure, is how much the lender feels comfortable to lend based on estimated repayment ability of borrowers. Therefore line evaluation ties to two main factors, one is estimated repayment amount and one is risk. The first one is critical to make offered line meaningful regarding borrowers' financial condition, such as borrowers'revenue, borrowing needs. Ignoring the first one will make the lending product less attractive to applicants/customers and will impact product engagement and growth. The second factor regarding risk is critical as it will help control the exposure at each risk level, in order to map to risk appetite at the overall level. The second one usually uses the static segmentation approach, provide the maximal line threshold at respective risk level. 

As mentioned earlier, the key input to line evaluation is repayment ability. Repayment ability can be considered as cash in hand during the loan term after deducting debts obligation from income. Since longer the loan duration more uncertainty it is, line for 12-months loan should be lower than two times of 6 month loan, as we will discount 12 month line due to repayment uncertainty. For small business loan, there are mainly two loan types, one is short term to cover working capital needs and one is for business expansion. For the former one, which is used to cover shortage of cash flow as payable happens several months before receivable, in this situation when we evaluate line, the COGS and OPEX part of revenue will be included in the line equation Vs. for longer term loan, we need to consider EBITA to ensure there is sufficient revenue margin to cover repayment.

   Customer Line Decision

Customer line is managed in a way to further grow loyal customers while control risk exposure once early stress signal surfaces. 

For line increase, it includes *proactive line increase* which means the lender proactively offers line increase to customers with low risk and high needs to ensure they are at the top of their wallet preference, *reactive line increase* is to provide a channel for customers to request line increase due to unsatisfied existing line. The challenge for *proactive line increase* is to capture customers' needs on time and improve line increase efficiency, while the challenge for *reactive line increase* is to create alternative options to re-visit the line logic, several options we see so far include additional bank connection, financial statements.

For line decrease, it can be line reduction, line suspension and account closure due to severity level of stress and repayment behavior. The signal usually comes from either risk or revenue. For example during pandemic period, due to macroeconomic uncertainty condition, the majority of portfolio's line will be reduced with the level ties to risk band to protect portfolio risk exposure. For line suspension or account closure, which means temporary or permernantly no access to the line, it equivalents to reducing line to zero, which usually caused by very certain condition of financial stress, such as internal and external mispayment.

The best way to manage line decison throughout customer life-cycle is to have consistent line strategy & logic and adjustable ratio to reflect risk and uncertainty.
