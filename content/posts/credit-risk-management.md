**What and Why**

Credit risk management is a cornerstone of the lending industry. Since the lending business model relies on balancing risk and return, the key objective is to control credit risk to achieve predictable and profitable outcomes within a defined risk appetite. A lender’s risk appetite reflects its tolerance for uncertainty — the higher the uncertainty, the greater the margin buffer required to absorb potential losses. Therefore, the role of a credit risk manager is to align risk appetite with business goals, driving portfolio growth with calculated risk, while continuously monitoring acquisition quality and portfolio performance to ensure ongoing alignment with strategy.

**Key Challenges**

One of the main challenges in credit risk management is the need to adapt policies to an ever-changing risk environment — influenced by both macroeconomic conditions and shifts in customer behavior or applicant profiles. Effective credit risk management requires risk assessment across the entire customer lifecycle, from acquisition to ongoing account management.

Below are some of the key challenges commonly faced in consumer and small business credit risk management, which I will explore further in upcoming articles:
- Acquisition stage: How should credit risk be assessed for new products or new customer populations?
- Early performance: If signs of deterioration appear during the initial customer journey, how can we identify root causes and adjust policies accordingly?
- Credit line assignment: How do we determine an appropriate initial line, balancing customer experience with risk control?
- Customer management: How should we define customer strategies such as line increases, line decreases, suspensions, or closures?
- Pricing: How does risk influence pricing, and how can we design dynamic, risk-based pricing strategies?
- Modeling: How can machine learning and alternative data be leveraged to detect early signs of financial distress?
