**What and Why**

The *credit risk managemnet* is very critial for lending industry, as lending business model is to control risk to achieve predictable and profitable return based on pre-set risk appetite. Risk appetite relfects in uncertainty, higher level of uncertainty requires more buffer in margin to cover the risk. Therefore, credit risk manager's role is to align risk appetite with business goal to achieve portfolio growth with calculated risk, and to closely monitor acquisition quality and portfolio performance to ensure well alignment with risk appetite.

**Key Challenges**

The challenging parts of this role to adjust policies to accomodate the ever-changing of credit risk caused by macroeconomic conditions and customer/applicant's conditions. Credit risk management involves the risk accessment throughout customer life-cycle. I listed key challenges which we often face in consumer/small business credit risk management, and will discuss more in the following articles:

- Acquisition stage: How to assess credit risk for new products? How to assess risk of new population?
- Acquisition stage: If there is a sign of deterioration during early customer journey, how to identify the root cause and make policy changes?
- Acquisition stage: How to appropriately assign initial line, so it's not too low to disappoint applicants while maintaining risk control.
- Customer management stage: How to define the customer strategy, such as line increase, line decrease, account suspension, account closed.
- Pricing: How risk impacts pricing, how to create dynamic risk-based pricing. 
- Modeling: How to leverage machine learning and new data sources to discover the early sign of financial distress. 

What and Why

Credit risk management is a cornerstone of the lending industry. Since the lending business model relies on balancing risk and return, the key objective is to control credit risk to achieve predictable and profitable outcomes within a defined risk appetite.

A lender’s risk appetite reflects its tolerance for uncertainty — the higher the uncertainty, the greater the margin buffer required to absorb potential losses. Therefore, the role of a credit risk manager is to align risk appetite with business goals, driving portfolio growth with calculated risk, while continuously monitoring acquisition quality and portfolio performance to ensure ongoing alignment with strategy.

Key Challenges

One of the main challenges in credit risk management is the need to adapt policies to an ever-changing risk environment — influenced by both macroeconomic conditions and shifts in customer behavior or applicant profiles. Effective credit risk management requires risk assessment across the entire customer lifecycle, from acquisition to ongoing account management.

Below are some of the key challenges commonly faced in consumer and small business credit risk management, which I will explore further in upcoming articles:

Acquisition stage: How should credit risk be assessed for new products or new customer populations?

Early performance: If signs of deterioration appear during the initial customer journey, how can we identify root causes and adjust policies accordingly?

Credit line assignment: How do we determine an appropriate initial line, balancing customer experience with risk control?

Customer management: How should we define customer strategies such as line increases, line decreases, suspensions, or closures?

Pricing: How does risk influence pricing, and how can we design dynamic, risk-based pricing strategies?

Modeling: How can machine learning and alternative data be leveraged to detect early signs of financial distress?
