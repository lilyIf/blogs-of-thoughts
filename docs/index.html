    <p><strong>Initial Line Decision</strong>
In addition to yes or no decision during the application stage, initial ine is one more key decision the lender needs to make. Line is risk exposure, is how much the lender feels comfortable to lend based on estimated repayment ability of borrowers. Therefore line evaluation ties to two main factors, one is estimated repayment amount and one is risk. The first one is critical to make offered line meaningful regarding borrowers&rsquo; financial condition, such as borrowers&rsquo;revenue, borrowing needs. Ignoring the first one will make the lending product less attractive to applicants/customers and will impact product engagement and growth. The second factor regarding risk is critical as it will help control the exposure at each risk level, in order to map to risk appetite at the overall level. The second one usually uses the static segmentation approach, provide the maximal line threshold at respective risk level.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the key input to line evaluation is repayment ability. Repayment ability can be considered as cash in hand during the loan term after deducting debts obligation from income. Since longer the loan duration more uncertainty it is, line for 12-months loan should be lower than two times of 6 month loan, as we will discount 12 month line due to repayment uncertainty. For small business loan, there are mainly two loan types, one is short term to cover working capital needs and one is for business expansion. For the former one, which is used to cover shortage of cash flow as payable happens several months before receivable, in this situation when we evaluate line, the COGS and OPEX part of revenue will be included in the line equation Vs. for longer term loan, we need to consider EBITA to ensure there is sufficient revenue margin to cover repayment.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Line Decision</strong>
Customer line is managed in a way to further grow loyal customers while control risk exposure once early stress signal surfaces.</p>
<p>For line increase, it includes <em>proactive line increase</em> which means the lender proactively offers line increase to customers with low risk and high needs to ensure they are at the top of their wallet preference, <em>reactive line increase</em> is to provide a channel for customers to request line increase due to unsatisfied existing line. The challenge for <em>proactive line increase</em> is to capture customers&rsquo; needs on time and improve line increase efficiency with risk control, the common way to do it is to conduct incremental debt sensitivity analysis to stress test the upper bound of limit.The challenge for <em>reactive line increase</em> is to create alternative options to re-visit the line logic, several options we see so far include additional bank connection, financial statements.</p>
<p>For line decrease, it can be line reduction, line suspension and account closure due to severity level of stress and repayment behavior. The signal usually comes from either risk or revenue. For example during pandemic period, due to macroeconomic uncertainty condition, the majority of portfolio&rsquo;s line will be reduced with the level ties to risk band to protect portfolio risk exposure. For line suspension or account closure, which means temporary or permernantly no access to the line, it equivalents to reducing line to zero, which usually caused by very certain condition of financial stress, such as internal and external mispayment.</p>
<p>The best way to manage line decison throughout customer life-cycle is to have consistent line strategy &amp; logic and adjustable ratio to reflect risk and uncertainty.</p>

    <p><strong>What and Why</strong>
The <em>credit risk managemnet</em> is very critial for lending industry, as lending business model is to control risk to achieve predictable and profitable return based on pre-set risk appetite. Risk appetite relfects in uncertainty, higher level of uncertainty requires more buffer in margin to cover the risk. Therefore, credit risk manager&rsquo;s role is to align risk appetite with business goal to achieve portfolio growth with calculated risk, and to closely monitor acquisition quality and portfolio performance to ensure well alignment with risk appetite.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges</strong>
The challenging parts of this role to adjust policies to accomodate the ever-changing of credit risk caused by macroeconomic conditions and customer/applicant&rsquo;s conditions. Credit risk management involves the risk accessment throughout customer life-cycle. I listed key challenges which we often face in consumer/small business credit risk management, and will discuss more in the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition stage: How to assess credit risk for new products? How to assess risk of new population?</li>
<li>Acquisition stage: If there is a sign of deterioration during early customer journey, how to identify the root cause and make policy changes?</li>
<li>Acquisition stage: How to appropriately assign initial line, so it&rsquo;s not too low to disappoint applicants while maintaining risk control.</li>
<li>Customer management stage: How to define the customer strategy, such as line increase, line decrease, account suspension, account closed.</li>
<li>Pricing: How risk impacts pricing, how to create dynamic risk-based pricing.</li>
<li>Modeling: How to leverage machine learning and new data sources to discover the early sign of financial distress.</li>
</ul>
