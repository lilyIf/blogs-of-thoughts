    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Credit Expansion
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Credit expansion should be one of most excited and daunting tasks for credit risk manager, as it&rsquo;s an uncharted landscape to step feet into. It has a wide coverage, from new market expansion, to new product expansion, to new population. Based on my experience on new product and new population expansion, it requires very cautious move. For new population expansion, which usually involves of high risk low credit history population, lender can either start with small population with sufficient reserve in finance or sell the risk externally to get learning benefit. For new product expansion, idealy it can leverage bureau to see internal population&rsquo;s external performance on product with similar features as new product to facilitate risk model development, or just get the sense of risk level by comparing their performance at the same risk level to form strategy. If new product has existed historically , it can be learned from historical data by mapping to one product which exist before and now, to gain the risk level in nowaday. If new product is a modification of an existing product, some level of proxy can be derived based on existing product, however given different loan terms target different borrowing needs and motivation, it&rsquo;s hard to generalize a relationship.</p>
<p>Once target default rate is defined for respective risk band, we need to ensure there is an early default indicator to be tracked regularly to monitor if performance expected. Any deviation needs to be investigated at granular level, such as vintage level, risk &amp; revenue level to dissect root cause. If root cause can be removed to bring risk band back to target default rate, then we just need to deal with the back book and close the front book based on this root cause. However if root cause can&rsquo;t be identified, and it seems a miscalcualtion of target default rate or due to change of economic condition, then based on level of credit deviation we need to come up with next step strategy on both front and back book, to either increase the pricing or reduce of risk exposure on higher than expected risk segment to contain the risk.</p>
<p>Credit expansion is one of the most exciting yet daunting responsibilities for a credit risk manager — it represents an uncharted landscape filled with opportunities and uncertainty. The scope is broad, covering new market entry, new product launches, and expansion into new customer populations.</p>
<p>From my experience in new product and population expansion, such initiatives require a highly cautious and data-driven approach. In new population expansion, which often targets higher-risk borrowers with limited credit history, lenders can either start small with sufficient financial reserves, or transfer part of the risk externally to gain early learning benefits.</p>
<p>In new product expansion, ideally, one can leverage credit bureau data to observe how existing customers perform externally on similar products, aiding model development and risk calibration. Alternatively, comparing products at similar risk levels can help estimate the expected risk level.</p>
<p>If the new product has historical precedence, it can be mapped to an existing product to infer today’s risk characteristics. When the new product is merely a variant of an existing offering, certain proxy relationships may be derived — however, because different loan terms attract different borrowing motivations, it is often challenging to generalize a direct relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Once target default rates are defined for each risk band, it becomes critical to establish early default indicators and track them regularly to ensure performance aligns with expectations. Any deviation should be investigated at a granular level — such as by vintage, risk tier, or revenue cohort — to dissect the root cause.</p>
<p>If the issue is identifiable and correctable, adjustments can be made to restore the portfolio to its target default level, while managing the back book and temporarily pausing new originations in affected segments. However, if the root cause is unclear, or stems from a miscalculated target rate or shifts in the economic environment, the lender must reassess strategy. Depending on the severity of deviation, this may include raising pricing, tightening credit criteria, or reducing exposure to risk segments to contain the risk.</p>

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Pricing
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Pricing is a very critical decision usually co-owned by product and risk, it can significanlty impact customers&rsquo; usage of lending product. We have observed the shift of customers&rsquo; adoption of different loan terms purely caused by the change of pricing strategy. Pricing and risk are inseperable, a good pricing strategy requires a fully understanding of risk and its uncertainty. When we talk of pricing, there are several strategies, such as the one focuses on loss coverage ratio which makes sure the higher ratio for higher risk to compensate for higher level of uncertainty, there is one based on mininal ROEC on capital. Both of them embed risk uncertainty into the ratio to ensure pricing can well cover risk and its uncertainty level. In addition, for low risk segment, lender can also consider to match competitor strategy to gain low risk low margin balance.</p>
<p>Initial pricing ties to discrete risk band; customer stage often requires risk-based dynamic pricing strategy, which means price will regularly be re-visited to reflect the risk level especially for risk downgrade population. In term of frequency or triggers, it usually requires the support of infrastructure and needs.</p>

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Credit Model
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>All the credit strategy should be powered by models if sufficient data samples available, as models can capture much higher dimension of data information compared with the ones processed by human brain. Using new account model as an example, higher dimension means higher degree of discrimination detected from data, and model can capture true defaulter with less sacrifice of non-defaulter. Therefore we usually use <em>Gini</em> to measure overall discrimination power and <em>Capture rate at top X%</em> to check the potential performance in strategy, the way to use the model to set a cutoff threshold to decline applicants. Once a cutoff has been set, it will be natually bring in two types of errors, type I and type II errors. Type I error (false positive) for credit model is to classify non-defaulters as defaulters and yields decline decision. Type II error (false negative) is to consider defaulters as non-defaulters. The cost of Type I error is lossing a good customer, and cost of Type II error is default risk. Therefore, credit risk management is to design a strategy to manage type II error. However you can consider an extreme case, with a perfect model which can score highest for all the defaulters and we set a threshold perfectly to seperate out all the defaulters from non-defaulters, we will have 0% for both Type I and Type II errors; with imperfect model in reality, type I and type II error trade off with each other based on the cutoff selection, which means we will either sacrifice many good customers for low default risk, or bring in more defaulters for high approval rate. Based on above, we can tell the importance of a powerful model, and importance of cutoff threshold selection on the impact of business growth and credit performance. Therefore, the contribution of a good model to bring in more good customer given the same default risk.</p>
<p>Another use case which requires the model is around line assignment, the line strategy without model usually only focus on risk and repayment, however the model can introduce long view on card member value (CMV), which is the combination of component such as borrowing revenue, spending revenue and risk cost. Each applicant will be assessed at these three dimensions and the line which provides highest CMV will be offered to customers after layered with many other policies.</p>
<p>The majoirty of credit models are based on supervised modeling technique as there is tag to be used for prediction, however unsupervised models on the other sidecan add value as well. Unsupervised modeling is a common technique for classification when tag is not available, it&rsquo;s ideal to handle situation when the relationship between dep and indep is not well defined, such as used as anomaly detector or high balance loss capture. However to assess the production feasibility to implement a new modeling technique, it requires many considerations, such as  tradeoff in type I and II errors, implementation complexity, interpretation requirement.</p>
<p>Credit model&rsquo;s main challenges are around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Representative: As modeling data is always the ones have been observed historically. We need to check the following to ensure the model performance is consistent between production and development stages: if the modeling data similar to the data in production, in terms of population coverage and relationship trend.</li>
<li>Data Treatment: How to treat blank and outlier in modeling dataset, will they provide meaningful relationship to target variables OR they are just noise.</li>
<li>Data Scarcity: How to handle extreme conditions which is rarely shown in modeling data, such as extremely high balance. Sampling technique is one of ways to ensure the model reflects correctly on the biased sitution.</li>
<li>Feature Engineering: Given raw data, how to bring out the insights from data. Traditional way mainly focuses around variable creation. Given recent surge of advanced machine learning techniques, NN and LLM can help capture many patterns exist in time series, NLP to nowadays&rsquo; models.</li>
<li>Model Redevelopment/Refreshment: As more production data comes in, can we identify a deterioration signal to redevelope the model or make model to have self-learning ability to adapt to the new trend.</li>
<li>Model Interpretation: How to interprete advanced model, such as NN, NLP, LLM in credit decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflect modeling challenges from above, it comes the following focus areas when we conduct model validation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Model Usage and assumption: understand the model use case in business, and confirm if modeling data is suitable and match model usage;</li>
<li>Data: ensure modeling data and production data are similar in terms of coverage and behavior;</li>
<li>Model performance: detect model overfitting by checking model performance consistency across out-of-time and out-of-sample</li>
<li>Ongoing monitoring: set up monitoring strategy to raise alarm on model deterioration and model redevelopment</li>
</ol>

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Line Philosophy
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><strong>Initial Line Decision</strong></p>
<p>In addition to yes or no decision during the application stage, initial ine is one more key decision the lender needs to make. Line is risk exposure, is how much the lender feels comfortable to lend based on estimated repayment ability of borrowers. Therefore line evaluation ties to two main factors, one is estimated repayment amount and one is risk. The first one is critical to make offered line meaningful regarding borrowers&rsquo; financial condition, such as borrowers&rsquo;revenue, borrowing needs. Ignoring the first one will make the lending product less attractive to applicants/customers and will impact product engagement and growth. The second factor regarding risk is critical as it will help control the exposure at each risk level, in order to map to risk appetite at the overall level. The second one usually uses the static segmentation approach, provide the maximal line threshold at respective risk level.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the key input to line evaluation is repayment ability. Repayment ability can be considered as cash in hand during the loan term after deducting debts obligation from income. Since longer the loan duration more uncertainty it is, line for 12-months loan should be lower than two times of 6 month loan, as we will discount 12 month line due to repayment uncertainty. For small business loan, there are mainly two loan types, one is short term to cover working capital needs and one is for business expansion. For the former one, which is used to cover shortage of cash flow as payable happens several months before receivable, in this situation when we evaluate line, the COGS and OPEX part of revenue will be included in the line equation Vs. for longer term loan, we need to consider EBITA to ensure there is sufficient revenue margin to cover repayment.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Line Decision</strong></p>
<p>Customer line is managed in a way to further grow loyal customers while control risk exposure once early stress signal surfaces.</p>
<p>For line increase, it includes <em>proactive line increase</em> which means the lender proactively offers line increase to customers with low risk and high needs to ensure they are at the top of their wallet preference, <em>reactive line increase</em> is to provide a channel for customers to request line increase due to unsatisfied existing line. The challenge for <em>proactive line increase</em> is to capture customers&rsquo; needs on time and improve line increase efficiency with risk control, the common way to do it is to conduct incremental debt sensitivity analysis to stress test the upper bound of limit.The challenge for <em>reactive line increase</em> is to create alternative options to re-visit the line logic, several options we see so far include additional bank connection, financial statements.</p>
<p>For line decrease, it can be line reduction, line suspension and account closure due to severity level of stress and repayment behavior. The signal usually comes from either risk or revenue. For example during pandemic period, due to macroeconomic uncertainty condition, the majority of portfolio&rsquo;s line will be reduced with the level ties to risk band to protect portfolio risk exposure. For line suspension or account closure, which means temporary or permernantly no access to the line, it equivalents to reducing line to zero, which usually caused by very certain condition of financial stress, such as internal and external mispayment.</p>
<p>The best way to manage line decison throughout customer life-cycle is to have consistent line strategy &amp; logic and adjustable ratio to reflect risk and uncertainty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><strong>What and Why</strong></p>
<p>The <em>credit risk managemnet</em> is very critial for lending industry, as lending business model is to control risk to achieve predictable and profitable return based on pre-set risk appetite. Risk appetite relfects in uncertainty, higher level of uncertainty requires more buffer in margin to cover the risk. Therefore, credit risk manager&rsquo;s role is to align risk appetite with business goal to achieve portfolio growth with calculated risk, and to closely monitor acquisition quality and portfolio performance to ensure well alignment with risk appetite.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The challenging parts of this role to adjust policies to accomodate the ever-changing of credit risk caused by macroeconomic conditions and customer/applicant&rsquo;s conditions. Credit risk management involves the risk accessment throughout customer life-cycle. I listed key challenges which we often face in consumer/small business credit risk management, and will discuss more in the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition stage: How to assess credit risk for new products? How to assess risk of new population?</li>
<li>Acquisition stage: If there is a sign of deterioration during early customer journey, how to identify the root cause and make policy changes?</li>
<li>Acquisition stage: How to appropriately assign initial line, so it&rsquo;s not too low to disappoint applicants while maintaining risk control.</li>
<li>Customer management stage: How to define the customer strategy, such as line increase, line decrease, account suspension, account closed.</li>
<li>Pricing: How risk impacts pricing, how to create dynamic risk-based pricing.</li>
<li>Modeling: How to leverage machine learning and new data sources to discover the early sign of financial distress.</li>
