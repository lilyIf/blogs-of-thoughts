For credit team, the dashboard can provide the information to help detect early warning signals of credit deterioration and informs future credit strategies—whether to expand or tighten credit criteria. Beyond the credit team, other departments such as Finance and Product teams also rely on portfolio performance tracking reports. The Finance team uses the insights to refine financial projections, while the Product team leverages them to evaluate and adjust pricing strategies.\nWhen designing a portfolio credit dashboard, it’s helpful to structure it into standard section, which are monitored regularly, and designated section, which are used for specific conditions or functional teams’ needs.\nStandard Sections\nDelinquency Rate Delinquency or write-off (WO) is commonly defined at 90 days past due (90+ DPD). The delinquency rate is typically calculated as: Delinquent balance ÷ Total Accounts Receivable (AR).This metric provides a simple and intuitive measure for the Finance team to estimate the expected annualized write-off rate at AR level. However, for a growing portfolio or newly release lending product, this metric can be misleading because AR growth naturally suppresses the apparent delinquency rate. To address this, a more accurate measure for growing products is to calculate delinquency using the AR from three months prior as the denominator. As the portfolio matures, the difference between the two measures should narrow. In practice, we often refer to these two measures as coincidental write-off vs. contractual write-off to distinguish between the “current” vs. “lag-adjusted” perspectives.\nRisk Band-Level View Risk bands are among the most powerful tools for differentiating credit risk. They can be based on FICO scores or internal risk scores, depending on the audience and purpose. For instance, in a cross-product risk review, FICO will be more appropriate as different product may own respective risk score. At the risk-band level, we can monitor: new account and customer distribution, average line size,delinquency rate, accounts receivable by risk level. Tracking these metrics over time offers a clear view of risk trends and AR allocation. For simplicity, some reports use a risk-weighted index to represent the overall change in portfolio risk over time.\nDesignated Tracking for Specific Needs\nNew Account Delinquency Spike New account delinquency tracking focuses on recently approved customers. Two metrics are commonly used:\nEvent delinquency rate (number of delinquent accounts ÷ total accounts) Dollar delinquency rate (delinquent balance ÷ total balance) An increase in new account delinquency can result from: a particular customer segment performing worse than expected, or a higher concentration of new accounts in riskier bands. To diagnose the issue:\nRisk band distribution charts to identify changes in population mix Tracking delinquency by risk band over time to find deteriorating segments. Once the root cause is identified, the credit team can take corrective actions—such as tightening risk controls or collaborating with Product and Marketing to attract higher-quality customers. If only dollar delinquency rises (with stable event delinquency), the likely cause is overly high initial credit lines for risky customers. Dashboards can be designed to track: Average initial line by segment over time The ratio of “average bad initial line” to “average good initial line” These indicators help assess whether initial line assignments are appropriately risk-adjusted. Portfolio Delinquency Spike When overall portfolio performance worsens—after accounting for new-account and line-assignment effects, the root cause often lies in customer management, especially line reduction strategy. To analyze this, we look from two angles:\nRisk distribution — how the portfolio’s risk composition shifts over time Performance per risk band — how each risk segment performs In addition, by tracking delinquency across segments and monitoring the ratio of “average bad AR” to “average good AR”, we can evaluate how effective line management is at controlling risk. If the portfolio gradually shifts toward higher-risk segments, it may signal that the overall portfolio is under stress. The response should be to reduce exposure at majoirity population or revisit acquisition strategies. If the overall distribution is stable but only certain segments deteriorate, those segments can be isolated and addressed in both back-book (existing accounts) and front-book (new originations).\nGrowth Growth strategies often stem from fulfilling unmet needs—either those expressed by customers or identified by the lender, or creating needs. For fulfilling unmet needs we usually deploy line strategy, the growth driven by customer demand of higher line tends to be more sustainable and effective, the growth driven by lender incentives (e.g., aggressive line increases) can create unused exposure and contingent risk, especially in economic downturns. To measure growth effectiveness: for line increase strategy, compare the ratio of “balance increase” to “line increase” using A/B testing. For creating needs, promotional pricing can be one of options, to measure the effectinve of promotional pricing, track the incremental balance after promotions to ensure the lift in AR offsets the cost of the promotion. Both approaches provide a quantitative way to evaluate whether growth initiatives genuinely enhance portfolio health and profitability.\n",
