It also helps measure the effectiveness of various risk strategies. Beyond the credit function, the dashboard supports cross-functional discussions with finance and product teams. For instance, it helps align delinquency projections with finance and evaluate risk-based pricing strategies with product. Below are several key dashboard components and charts that help visualize portfolio risk, monitor performance, and identify opportunities to enhance risk control and strategy efficiency.\nDelinquency Rate Trend Delinquency or write-off (WO) is commonly defined as account 90 days past due (90+DPD). The delinquency dollar rate is typically calculated as: Delinquent balance ÷ Total Accounts Receivable (AR) as of the end of the month. This metric provides a simple and intuitive measure for the finance team to estimate the expected annualized write-off rate, which is monthly WO rate * 12. However, for a growing portfolio or newly release lending product, this metric can be misleading because AR growth naturally suppresses the apparent delinquency rate. To address this, a more accurate measure for growing products is to calculate delinquency using the AR from three months prior as the denominator. As the portfolio matures, the difference between the two measures should narrow. To gain a holistic view of the risk trend and predict upcoming 90+DPD rate, complementary metrics such as 30DPD, 60DPD, as well as 30DPD-60DPD and 60DPD-90DPD should be monitored as well.\nRisk-Based View When delinquency rises, it can stem from two different drivers: 1. worsening risk performance within risk segments; 2. shift in portfolio mix toward higher-risk segments. Displaying metrics for both impacts helps pinpoint the root cause of the deterioration, whether it’s within-segment performance or portfolio distribution shift, and guides targeted corrective actions.\nline and Customer Management Strategy Efficiency As mentioned in line strategy framework, an effective credit line strategy should be able to: 1. offer meaningful line size to attract and retain good customers, and 2. limit exposure to high risk segments. Line assignment typically includes two constraints: 1. meaningful line size: based on customer debt capacity; 2. risk-based line cap: based on segment-level risk tolerance. The final line is the minimum of these two components. In order to measure adoption efficiency, we will need to track activation rate among low-risk segments; to assess risk control efficiency, we need to monitor dollar default rate trends and compare them with target rates. Based on these results, we can calibrate initial line assignment as well as line reduction strategies to rebalance AR from high and low quality account across both the front book and back book.\nGrowth Strategy Efficiency Growth strategies often stem from fulfilling unmet needs—either those expressed by customers or identified by the lender, or creating needs. For fulfilling unmet needs we usually deploy line increase strategy, we usually compare the ratio of “balance increase” to “line increase” using A/B testing to measure effectiveness of line increase strategy. For creating needs, promotional pricing can be one of options, to measure the effectiveness of promotional pricing, track the incremental balance after promotions to ensure the lift in AR offsets the cost of the pricing campaign. Both approaches provide a quantitative way to evaluate whether growth initiatives genuinely enhance portfolio health and profitability.\n",
