The cost of Type I error is lossing a good customer, and cost of Type II error is default risk. Therefore, credit risk management is to design a strategy to manage type II error. However you can consider an extreme case, with a perfect model which can score highest for all the defaulters and we set a threshold perfectly to seperate out all the defaulters from non-defaulters, we will have 0% for both Type I and Type II errors; with imperfect model in reality, type I and type II error trade off with each other based on the cutoff selection, which means we will either sacrifice many good customers for low default risk, or bring in more defaulters for high approval rate. Based on above, we can tell the importance of a powerful model, and importance of cutoff threshold selection on the impact of business growth and credit performance.
